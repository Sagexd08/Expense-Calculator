Personal Spending Tracker Application with Data Visualization

The Personal Expense Tracker is an application implemented in Python, designed to help users manage and visualize their personal expenses. It allows users to add expenses, categorize them, and visualize this data for future reference using data visualization.

Key Features:
Add Expenses: Users can log expenses by entering the amount, category (such as food, rent, transport), and date. If a date is not provided, the current date is used by default. The data is saved in a CSV file, making it easy to store and access later.

Expense List: Users can view a table of all their recorded expenses, providing a quick overview of daily, weekly, or monthly spending patterns and the categories of those expenses.

Data Visualization:

Pie Chart of Expenses by Category: This view allows users to understand how their spending is distributed across different categories, showing what portion of their total spending goes toward things like food, rent, or transport.
Line Graph of Expenses by Date: A line graph provides insight into how a user's spending changes over time, allowing them to track spending trends, peak spending days, or see how well they followed their budget over time.
How to Use:
Run the Program: Install the required Python libraries (pandas, matplotlib) and launch the script.
Option Selection: A menu lets users choose to add an expense, view recorded data, or generate visualizations. Each expense can also be customized by category and date.
Chart Spending: Users can generate either a pie chart to see the distribution of spending by category or a line graph to visualize expenses over time.
Benefits:
This project helps users gain better control over their finances by easily tracking and categorizing expenses. Visualizing spending habits allows users to make informed decisions about budgeting and expense management. Whether they want to reduce spending in certain categories or monitor daily financial habits, the app provides an accessible way to stay on top of their spending.

Possible Extensions:
Add multi-user support for families or groups.
Integrate a database for more advanced data management.
Provide detailed monthly reports summarizing all expenses.
Overall, this project serves as a useful tool for personal finance management and can be extended or customized to meet user needs.
